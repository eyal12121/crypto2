How To Use:

Initialization
First, create instances of the MainServer and Client classes:
main_server = MainServer()
client = Client(main_server)

Adding a File
To add a file to the system, use the add_file method:
client.add_file(file_path)


Fetching a File
To request a file from the server, use the request_file method. This will save the file to the specified output path:
client.request_file(file_path, output_file)

Deleting a File
Only the user who initially added the file can delete it. To remove a file, use:
client.remove_file(file_path)
