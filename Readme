for initilization we need to make an instance of a client and a main server, for example:
    main_server = MainServer()
    client = Client(main_server)

to add file to the system:
    client.add_file(file_path)

to fetch a file:
    client.request_file(file_path, output_file)[1]

to delete a file(only the user who authorize to delete it):
    client.remove_file(file_path)
